# Deep Learning From Scratch code

This repo contains all the code from the book [Deep Learning From Scratch](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Scratch-Building-Principles/dp/1492041416), published by O'Reilly in September 2019.

It was mostly for me to keep the code I was writing for the book organized, but my hope is readers can clone this repo and step through the code systematically themselves to better understand the concepts.

## Structure

Each chapter has two notebooks: a `Code` notebook and a `Math` notebook. Each `Code` notebook contains the Python code for corresponding chapter and can be run start to finish to generate the results from the chapters. The `Math` notebooks were just for me to store the LaTeX equations used in the book, taking advantage of Jupyter's LaTeX rendering functionality.
